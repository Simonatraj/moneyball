# Moneyball – CS50 SQL Problem Set

This repository contains my solutions to the *Moneyball* problem set from CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL.

## Overview

Using real MLB data, the project challenges you to write SQL queries that help the Oakland A’s identify undervalued players and make cost-effective team decisions. Topics include data filtering, aggregation, and joins.

## Files

- `moneyball.sql` – SQL queries solving the problem set
- `moneyball.db` – Provided SQLite database 

## ERD/ Database structure

Detailed description of the database structure, including tables and their relationships, refer to the:[(https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/psets/1/moneyball/)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/psets/1/moneyball/)

## How to Use

Open `moneyball.db` with a SQLite browser or command line, and run the queries from `moneyball.sql` to reproduce the results.
